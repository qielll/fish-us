A landing page of services company simulation on Roblox game.

This website is a college midterm project, the objective of this project is to implement Javascript, CSS and HTML subjects that we learn. What I will be presenting is a landing page website where it will be simulating a company that offers services, in this context the compay offer services to a Roblox game player.

This project is made with native Javascript and Tailwind CSS framework, it's simple and basic but it helps me learn more about basics part that i haven't got to learn and helps me remember stuff that i've learn a long time ago
